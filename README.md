# Clusterwise linear regression using self-organizing maps

This repository contains my dissertation for the statistical learning MsC TRIED (Traitement de l'Information et Exploitation des Donn√©es), as well as the presentation given in front of a jury.

My master thesis was about developing a clusterwise linear regression algorithm using self-organizing maps.
